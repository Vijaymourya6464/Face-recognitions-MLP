# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERNSHIP AT INTERNSHIPS STUDIO 
> Here I have completed 1 months training and 1 allocated project Face Recognition using python 

## Task-1 - MLP Face Recognition
## Description -
* The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Face Recognition System is an innovative project that leverages the power of artificial neural networks to identify and recognize faces.
   
* The project aims to develop a robust and efficient face recognition system using the MLP model, a type of feedforward artificial neural network.

##Software Requirements - 
Jupyter Notebook.
python
